## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any potential vulnerabilities. If you believe you have found a security issue in our project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue. Security vulnerabilities must be reported privately.

2. Send an email to [mike.gurin21@gmail.com](mailto:mike.gurin21@gmail.com) with the subject: "Security Vulnerability Report."

3. Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it. If possible, include any relevant code snippets or screenshots to help us understand the issue.

4. Our security team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and we will work with you to investigate, validate, and address the reported vulnerability.

5. Once the vulnerability has been addressed, we will release a fix in a secure manner and provide credit to the reporter (if desired) in the release notes or security advisory.

### Scope

Please note that this policy applies to security-related issues in our project's codebase and related software. For general bug reports, feature requests, or other non-security-related inquiries, please use the appropriate channels as specified in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

### Supported Versions

Our policy is to support the current stable release and the previous major release of our software. If a vulnerability is found in an unsupported version, we encourage users to upgrade to a supported release to receive the necessary security fixes.

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you do not publicly disclose any details of the vulnerability until we have had a chance to investigate and release a fix. We strive to respond to and resolve security issues promptly, and your cooperation in responsible disclosure helps protect our users.

### Attribution

We would like to express our gratitude to all security researchers and individuals who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to help us improve the security of our software.

Please note that this security policy is subject to change and improvement over time. We encourage you to check back periodically for any updates.
