# Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Time Management Project, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery
- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

Our project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the project.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a maintainer immediately. Maintainers may be contacted by email or through the project's chat room.

We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere within the project community, including in code, documentation, issues, chat rooms, mailing lists, and social media.
